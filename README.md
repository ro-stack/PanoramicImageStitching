Ronan Hayes - Assignment Two
HOW TO RUN:
- Firstly run the stitchRows program.
- This program uses 5 folders each containing 4 images, representing each 
row in the image.
- The output of the stitched rows will be saved to the folder stitchedRows.
- The best version of the stitchedRows are already in there, however if you
 run the program they will overwrite.
- Next run the stitchAll program.
- This uses the stitched row images from the stitchedRows folder to stitch
 them vertically.
- Like before, the best version of the panorama is already in the 
finalStitches folder.
- Another folder called best contains the current best outcome for all 
parts.

NOTE:
- The folder locations should work as they are when running the two 
programs, but may need to be changed if need be - see comments.
- I have included the best versions as the stitching is not always 100% 
(especially row2) and can mess up a lot of the time.
